This extension lets you manually define the slug of an individual discussion.
Once a manual slug is set, it won't be overridden even if the title changes.
You can revert to automatic to have the slug generated by the default method.

If you are using the FriendsOfFlarum Transliterator extension, you need to enable this extension **after** Transliterator for the manual slug to be applied.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-manual-discussion-slug

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
